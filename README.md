I have created a maven file, which contains a java code which recieves user input for a password, and it's hashtype and then when provided with a wordlist converts all the passwords in the wordlist to the given hash type and compares them to the given password and gives the output based on whether the given password existed in the wordfile or not.

It works similar to hashcat but currently I have added only known encryption algorithms.
